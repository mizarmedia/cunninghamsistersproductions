## 🔴 ACTIVE SESSION: CLAUDE-cunninghamsistersproductions-20260114-195156
**Started:** 2026-01-14 19:51:56

### Session Goal:
Study A24 Films website to understand their design system

### Actions This Session:
- Analyzed a24films.com/films page in detail
- Analyzed homepage and individual film pages
- Analyzed television page for consistency
- Created comprehensive A24_DESIGN_STUDY.md

### Key Discovery:
**Previous assumption was WRONG** - A24 uses WHITE background, not black!

## ✅ COMPLETED: CLAUDE-cunninghamsistersproductions-20260114-223045
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Goal:** Deploy mockups and fix A24 style to match actual A24 website
**Status:** Partial

### Accomplished:
- Deployed all 3 original mockups to Cloudflare Pages
- Attempted A24 mockup rework (2 iterations)
- Researched actual A24 Films website design language
- Identified key A24 style elements: black bg, image-forward gallery, minimal UI, film cards with title+year

### Issues Encountered:
- A24 mockup did not match actual A24 Films website style
- First attempt: White background with too many text sections - wrong aesthetic
- Second attempt: Black background but hero image too large, support button broken
- Wiped A24 mockup folder to start fresh next session

### Learnings:
- A24 website style: BLACK background, image-forward gallery design, minimal text, film cards with title+year below, interface recedes
- Need to study reference site more carefully before implementing
- User prefers starting fresh over iterating on wrong direction

### Stopping Point:
A24 mockup folder wiped clean. Ready to rebuild from scratch with proper A24 style study.

### Next Session:
- Deep study of A24 Films website (a24films.com) - exact layout, typography, spacing
- Build A24 mockup from scratch matching their actual aesthetic
- Fix Editorial and Cinematic mockups
- All mockups need: working buttons, proper mobile nav, smooth scroll

## ✅ COMPLETED: CSP-2026-01-14-001
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Goal:** Create 3 website mockups for Cunningham Sisters Productions
**Status:** Completed

### Accomplished:
- Scraped all content from current Squarespace site (cunninghamsistersproductions.com)
- Extracted team bios, film info, images, contact details, funding data
- Analyzed two reference sites: Modern Films and A24 Films
- Built 3 distinct mockup websites with HTML/CSS:
  1. **A24 Clone** - White, minimal, grid layout
  2. **Editorial** - Black bg, gold accents, text-forward
  3. **Cinematic** - Full-bleed parallax, immersive single-project
- Created index page to preview all mockups

### Issues Encountered:
- None significant

### Learnings:
- Client (Kenna Cunningham) prefers minimal, high-contrast aesthetic
- Reference sites share: white space, image-centric, gallery-like layouts
- Current project "Resilience" is in post-production, 59% funded ($89k of $150k)

### Stopping Point:
All 3 mockups complete. User was about to restart session to fix Cloudflare MCP auth for deploying to temp domains.

### Next Session:
- Initialize git repo
- Push to GitHub
- Deploy each mockup to Cloudflare Pages on temp domains
- Get client feedback on which direction to pursue

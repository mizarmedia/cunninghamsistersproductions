## ✅ COMPLETED: CSP-2026-01-14-001
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Goal:** Create 3 website mockups for Cunningham Sisters Productions
**Status:** Completed

### Accomplished:
- Scraped all content from current Squarespace site (cunninghamsistersproductions.com)
- Extracted team bios, film info, images, contact details, funding data
- Analyzed two reference sites: Modern Films and A24 Films
- Built 3 distinct mockup websites with HTML/CSS:
  1. **A24 Clone** - White, minimal, grid layout
  2. **Editorial** - Black bg, gold accents, text-forward
  3. **Cinematic** - Full-bleed parallax, immersive single-project
- Created index page to preview all mockups

### Issues Encountered:
- None significant

### Learnings:
- Client (Kenna Cunningham) prefers minimal, high-contrast aesthetic
- Reference sites share: white space, image-centric, gallery-like layouts
- Current project "Resilience" is in post-production, 59% funded ($89k of $150k)

### Stopping Point:
All 3 mockups complete. User was about to restart session to fix Cloudflare MCP auth for deploying to temp domains.

### Next Session:
- Initialize git repo
- Push to GitHub
- Deploy each mockup to Cloudflare Pages on temp domains
- Get client feedback on which direction to pursue

            <h2>About The Cunningham Sisters</h2>

            <p class="lead">The Cunningham Sisters are <strong>filmmakers</strong>, not musicians. Kenna and Madi Grace Cunningham founded The Cunningham Sisters Productions to create advocacy films that expose injustice and drive systemic change.</p>

            <p>Four years ago, they discovered disturbing stories about unregulated troubled teen programs and decided to document the issue through filmmaking. That decision led to <em>Resilience</em>, their debut feature film that shines light on practices that demand immediate reform.</p>

            <p>Through The Film Institute 501(c)(3), all donations to their films are tax-deductible. Their unique model splits proceeds: 50% goes to advocacy efforts for the cause featured in the film, and 50% funds future advocacy films.</p>
